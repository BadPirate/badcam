# BadCam

## Summary

A set of scripts and a node server to make reviewing and clearing out Tesla Sentry / Security Camera videos easier.  

## Goals

* No / Low cost server hosting
  * Using Dropbox API for free (though sometimes size limited) storage while videos wait to be reviewed
  * Using Heroku for free / hobby server space accessible from cloud
* Review from phone / Tesla Browser
* Push notifications
* "Prune" videos once you've seen them
